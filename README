rundev
======

Installation:

	go build -o ./rundevd ./cmd/daemon
	go build -o ./rundev  ./cmd/client

Integrate to your app:

- Build rundevd like described above.
- Add it to your container image's current working directory. (./rundevd)

Start developing:

	rundev -local-dir ~/workspace/py-hello \
	  -run-cmd "python app.py"

This command will:

  1. in-memory overwrite your Dockerfile to run ./rundevd
  2. build and push a container image to your project
  2. deploy your app to Cloud Run
  3. start a local HTTP server on localhost:8080 for development.

Every time you make a request to this address:
  - local file system will be synced (if necessary) to containers on Cloud Run
  - your app will be rebuilt and restarted (if necessary)
  - your query will be proxied to Cloud Run container instances.

In the command above:
  -local-dir contains path to source code on your machine.
  -run-cmd specifies entrypoint to your application
  -build-cmd (optional) is the command to rebuild your application
  -remote-dir specifies the directory inside the container to sync files to
  -addr specifies an alternative address to listen on
